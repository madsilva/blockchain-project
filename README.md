# blockchain-project

# How to run
## Prerequisites
- [Ganache GUI](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache)
- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)
  - We have tested the project using Firefox but in theory Chrome should work too.
- Node.js
- Python 3

## Instructions
1. Run Ganache GUI and create a new workspace with the following:
  - Under Truffle Projects, use the Add Project button to select the file `~/truffle/truffle-config.js` from the project directory.
  - Under Server set the port number to 8545.
2. Making sure the Ganache workspace is running, cd into `~/truffle/client` directory and run:
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run deploy:all`

6. In a separate terminal tab, cd into `~/truffle/client/oracle/test_json` and run `python3 main.py`
3. In a separate terminal tab, cd into `~/truffle/client/oracle/test_json` and run `python3 -m http.server` (or equivalent for your Python install).
  - This is so that the generated transaction JSON can be served to the AffiliateOracle.js script. 
4. In a separate teminal tab, cd into `~/truffle/client/oracle` and run `node AffiliateOracle.js`
  - This script handles requests for an affiliate's transaction information from the oracle contract.
5. In a separate terminal tab, cd into `~/truffle/client` and run `npm run start`. The project test website will be available at `http://localhost:3000/`.




## How to run (OLD)
1. Make sure you're using node 10.17.0
2. Install Truffle with `npm install --g truffle`
3. Download [Ganache GUI](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache)
4. Run Ganache GUI and create a new workspace with the following:
  - Under Truffle Projects, use the Add Project button to select the truffle-config.js file of the Truffle project. 
  - Under Server set the port number to 8545.
5. Download [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)
6. Click the Metamask icon in the browser and choose to import a seed phrase. Copy the mnemonic displayed in Ganache here. 
7. For the network in Metamask choose Localhost 8545, this should auto connect to Ganache.
8. You can make new accounts in Metamask and they will automatically be the accounts generated by Ganache in order. 
9. cd into `truffle/client` directory
10. Run:
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run deploy:all` (use this to redeploy every time you restart Ganache, or if you recompile contracts with changes, or if you otherwise need to reset)
11. cd into `oracle/test_json` directory and run `python3 -m http.server` in a terminal tab
12. cd back into `client/oracle` and run `node AffiliateOracle.js` in a terminal tab
13. cd back into `client` and run `npm run start`
